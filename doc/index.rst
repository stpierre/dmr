 dmr: Deduplicate My Resume
============================

`dmr <https://github.com/stpierre/dmr>`_ is **Deduplicate My Resume**.
It allows you to write your resume in `reStructuredText`_, a
semi-structured format that looks fine as plain text, and can be
rendered into many other formats.  It then provides tools to help you
render it into other formats with a great degree of control over the
format.

.. note::

    Mostly coincidentally, ``dmr`` is also the username of `Dennis
    Ritchie <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Ritchie>`_.
    Throughout these docs, I have used examples from Ritchie's own
    educational and work experience to illustrate use of dmr.  Like
    most computer geeks, I hold Ritchie in the highest esteem
    possible, and accordingly hope that my examples are respectful.  I
    haven't falsified any data about him -- all examples are true --
    with the exception of a few dates and other very minor details
    that I approximated.
